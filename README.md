# Project-1
My first project I decided to make a simple 1 player Hangman game where the user has to guess the hidden word before the hangman is drawn. The user is able to click on a letter and the computer will either output the letter into the word if they guess correct or a hangman part will be added to the hangman image. When the user has clicked on a letter and then clicked enter, the letter will turn red indicating that this letter has already been clicked which will help the user know whick letters not to click again. So far the game only fetches 3 words and if the user guesses all three words they will have won the game and they will lose if the hangman is drawn. Every time the user gets a word correct, the computer will wait 5 seconds and the game will reset by removing the hangman, setting the keyboard back to white, and hiding the next word.
